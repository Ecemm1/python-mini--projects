# python-mini--projects
Mini projects which I wrote when I was learning python.
I wrote every project in order to learn python.
# PROJECTS:
***** A mini guessing number game which you can access with password and name*****
It contains basic control of user name and password. If the conditions are correct, a mini random number guessing game will be opened.
After the game,the scores are saved to the file.

***** A mini diary*****
It saves the user's notes to a file. Reads when prompted.

***** A simple TO-DO List ******
It contains a simple menu with delete,show,exit and add functions.The user can add new task, delete task and view list. The code can run until
the exit option which can end the loop.

***** A simple Code That Controls If Input is a Palindrom*****
It contains a mini code block that checks if input is a palindrom. It means it checks whether the sentence or word is the same when reversed.
